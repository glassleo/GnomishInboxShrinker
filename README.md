# Gnomish Inbox Shrinker

This is an updated version of [Gnomish Inbox Shrinker](https://github.com/TekNoLogic/GnomishInboxShrinker) by [TekNoLogic](https://github.com/TekNoLogic) for modern WoW with some added improvements and fixes.

Gnomish Inbox Shrinker replaces the default inbox UI with a minimalistic, scrolling list that gives you a much better overview and no paging. It also plays well with other mailbox addons, such as Postal and Favorite Contacts.
