# Gnomish Inbox Shrinker

This is a fan update of [Gnomish Inbox Shrinker](https://github.com/TekNoLogic/GnomishInboxShrinker) by [TekNoLogic](https://github.com/TekNoLogic) for modern retail WoW.

Gnomish Inbox Shrinker replaces the default inbox UI with a minimalistic, scrolling list that gives you a much better overview and no paging. It also plays well with other mailbox addons, such as Postal and Favorite Contacts.

## Changes from the original addon

- Adjusted the layout to make room for the Open All button
- Fixed display issues in the Open Mail window
- Realm names are no longer displayed in the inbox, since they were taking up a lot of unnessecary space
- Compatibility updates for many years of API changes
